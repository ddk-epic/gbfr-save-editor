# Quests

Side quests and quest counter quests are parallel arrays at entity 0, one entry per quest.

## Quest ids

A quest id is a `quest_baseinfo_ex_data.Key`, 8 hex digits, stored as the uint the digits spell: `00401301` is 4,199,169.

| Prefix | Quests               |
| ------ | -------------------- |
| `002`  | Side quests          |
| `0040` | Quest counter quests |

- A quest's title is `TXT_QR_<id without the leading 00>` in `text_stage.msg`.

## Side quests

Three arrays of 200.

| Attribute | Name                  | Type        | Holds                                    |
| --------- | --------------------- | ----------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| 2550      | `SIDE_QUEST_IDS`      | `uint[200]` | Quest id, 0 on an unused entry           |
| 2551      | `SIDE_QUEST_STATE`    | `uint[200]` | 0 until completed, 1 or 2 once completed |
| 2555      | `SIDE_QUEST_ACCEPTED` | `bool[200]` | Accepted                                 |

- 2550 holds every side quest from a new game on, accepted or not.
- An accepted quest at 0 in 2551 is underway.
- A completed repeat quest stays accepted in 2555. The game lists it only once it is accepted again.

## Quest counter

Four arrays of 512.

| Attribute | Name                         | Type        | Holds                            |
| --------- | ---------------------------- | ----------- | -------------------------------- |
| 2570      | `COUNTER_QUEST_IDS`          | `uint[512]` | Quest id, 0 on an unused entry   |
| 2571      | `COUNTER_QUEST_CLEARS`       | `uint[512]` | Clear count                      |
| 2574      | `COUNTER_QUEST_FLAGS`        | `uint[512]` | Best grade                       |
| 2579      | `COUNTER_QUEST_LAST_CLEARED` | `uint[512]` | Last clear, Unix time in seconds |

- 2570 holds every quest counter quest from a new game on.
- The fifth digit of the id is the difficulty.
- 2571 sums to `PROFILE_QUESTS_CLEARED` (4901) on the own profile card.
- 2579 is recorded from game version 2.0.0 on. A quest not cleared since holds 0.
- Ids with no clears include ids not in `quest_baseinfo_ex_data`.

| Digit | Difficulty |
| ----- | ---------- |
| 1     | Easy       |
| 2     | Normal     |
| 3     | Hard       |
| 4     | Very Hard  |
| 5     | Extreme    |
| 6     | Maniac     |
| 7     | Proud      |
| 8     | Chaos      |
| 9     | Chaos+     |
| A     | Chaos++    |
| B     | Infinity   |

| 2574 | Best grade    |
| ---- | ------------- |
| 0    | C             |
| 1    | B             |
| 2    | A             |
| 3    | S             |
| 4    | S+            |
| 5    | S++           |
| 7    | Never cleared |

## Open

- 2551 is 2 only on a repeat quest, likely a clear count.
- 2505 at entity 0 lists the accepted side quests again, in another order. 2554 is false on every entry.
- 2575 is true on every cleared quest apart from the On the Threshold quests. 2576 is true on every cleared quest. 2577 holds three bools per quest that do not follow the first clear rewards. 2578 is mostly true alongside a 2579 time.
- 2580-2583 and 2501-2651 apart from the attributes above have no meaning assigned.
- 7351 at 0-127 holds quest counter ids of `infomation_quest`, with 7352 beside it. No meaning is assigned.
